# Vienna hand config parameters 
#
# node_id: The EPOS node id for that motor on the CAN bus, is 2*num + 1
# name: name of the joint in the robot description
# sensor_calibration: zero offset of the sensor, in raw sensor value as read from A/D converter
# sensor_direction: ensures that inwards = positive
# motor_direction: ensures that inwards = positive
# max_velocity: maximum motor velocity in rpm
# max_current: maximum allowed sustained current in mA
# max_peak_current: maximum allowed peak current in mA
